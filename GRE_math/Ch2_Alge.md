# Algebra
The main comcept that distinuishes algebra from arithmetic is that of a __value__, which is a letter that represents a quantity whose value is unknown. You must see the letters $x$ and $y$ used as variables. You can use variables to present a word problem in terms of unknown quantities by using algebraic expressions, equations, inequalities, and functions. 

# 2.1 Operations with Algebraic Expressions

An __algebraic expression__ has on or more variables and can be written as a single __term__ or as a sum of terms.
$$2x$$  $$y- \frac{1}{4}$$ $$w^3z+5z^2-w^2+6$$
In the examples above, $2x$ has a single term. $y-\frac{1}{4}$ has two terms and $w^3z+5z^2-w^2+6$ has four terms. A term that doesn't have variable is called a __constant__ term. A number that is multipled by variables is called the __coefficient__ of a term. For example, 5 is the coefficient of the term $5z^2$.

The same rules that govern with numbers apply to operations with algebraic expressions. Like terms can be combined by adding their cofficient. And a number or varialbe can be factored out.

$$3xy+2x-3y+4x+y=3xy+6x-2y$$
$$\frac{7x^2+14x}{2x+4}=\frac{7x(x+2)}{2(2x+2)}=\frac{7x}{2}$$

__Identity__ is a statement of equality between two variables that is true for all possible values.

$$(a+b)^2 = a^2+ab+b^2$$

# 2.2 Rules of Exponents

In the algebraic expression $x^a$, $x$ is called a __base__ and $a$ is called an __exponent__. There are seven basic ules of exponents.
1. $x^{-a}=\frac{1}{x^a}$
2. $(x^a)(x^b)=x^{a+b}$
3. $\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}$
4. $x^0=1$
5. $(x^a)(y^a)=(xy)^a$
6. $(\frac{x}{y})^a=\frac{x^a}{y^a}$
7. $(x^a)^b=x^ab$
   
But you should take care not to use these basic rules mistakenly. For example;

$$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\neqx+y$$

# 2.3 Solving Linear Equations

So, how can we solve an equation? Solving equation means to find the values of the variables that make the equation true. __Equivalent equation__ means two equations that have the same solutions. For example, $x+2=3$ and $2x+4=6$ are equivalent equations.

A __linear equation__ is an equation involving none of the variables are multiplied each other or raised to a power greater than 1.

## Linear equation in one variable

First, simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms. Then, check your solution by substituting it into the original equation. You should note that the equation can have no solution.
Let's slove a equation;


## Linear equations in Two Variables

A solution of such an equation is an ordered pair of numbers (x,y) that makes the equation true. 
Two equation with the same variables are called a system of equations, and the equations in the system are called simultaneous equations. 

There are twon basic methods for solving systems of linear equations, by substitution or by elimination.

* substitution
you can express x in the second equation in terms of y as x=2-2y. Then subsitute 2-2y for x in the first equation.

* Elimination
Make cofficients of x the same by multiplying. Then, if you substract the second equation from the first, you can get the value of y.

# 2.4 Solving Quadratic Equation

A basic form of a __quadratic equation__ is;
$$ax^2+bx+c=0$$
where a, b, and c are real numbers and $a \neq 0$. You can solve this equation using the __quadratidc formula__:
$$x= \frac{-b+-\sqrt{(b^2-4ac)}}{2a}$$
Usually quadratic equations have two real solutions, but when the expression under the square root symbol is equal to 0, they have only one real solution.

Some quadratic equations can be solved more quickly by factoring. 
$$2x^2-x-6=0$$
$$(2x+3)(x-2)=0$$
$$x=-\frac{3}{2} or x=2$$

# 2.5 Solving Linear Inequalities

A mathematical statement that uses one of the following inequality signs is called an __inequality__.


# 2.6 Function

An algebraic expression in one variable can be used to define a __function__ of that variable. An algebraic expression $3x+5$ can be used to defind a function $f$ by
$$f(x)=3x+5$$
where $f(x)$ is called the value of $f$ at $x$ and is obtained by substituting the value of x in the expression above. If $x=2$, the result is $f(2)=11$

There is a basic rule to be a function.

* Each domain has only one result.(But domains can have the same result.)


# 2.7 Application 

# 2.8 Coordinate Geometry

rectangular coordinate system, often called the xy-coordinate system or xy-plane. The horizontal number line is the x-axis and the vertical number line is the y-axis.
The point that two axes interect at 0 is called the origin, denoted by $O$. The plane is divided into four regions called quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4.
