Chapter3. Geometry
===
Geometry is concerned with properties of space.
The content of geometry begins with lines and angles and progresses to other plane figures, such as polygons, triangles, quadrilaterals, and circles.

# 3.1 Lines and Angles

A __point__ has no size and is the simplest geometic figure. A __line__ is understood to be a straight line that extends in both directions without end. A __plane__ can be thought of as a floor or a tabletop, except that a plane extends in all directions without end and has no thickness. 

* __line segment__: Given any two points on a line, the part of the line that contains the two points and all the points between them. 
* __endpoints__ : The two point above.
* __congruent line segments__ : Line segments that have equal lengths.
* __midpoint__ : The point that divides a line segment into two congruent line segments.

There are four angles, and each angle has a __vertex__ at point P.

In the figure, angles APC and BPD are called opposite angles or vertical angles. Angles that have equal measures are called congruent angles like APC and BPD. 

* __perpendicular lines__: two lines that intersect to form four congruent angles.
* __right angle__: an angle with a measure 90°
* __acute angle__: an angle with measure less than 90°
* __abtuse angle__: an angle with measure between 90 and 180
* __parallel lines__: two lines in the same plane that do not intersect

# 3.2 Polygons

A __polygon__ is a closed figure formed by three or more line segments, called sides and the endpoints are called vertices.

## Kinds of polygon
* Triangle
* Quadrilateral
* Pentagon
* Hexagon
If a polygon has $n$ sides, it can be divided into $n-2$ triangles. So, the sum of the measures of the interior angles of an n-sided ploygon is $(n-2)(180^\circ )$.

A polygon that all sides are congruent and all interior angles are congruent is called a __regular polygon__. (ex) regular triangle, square...

# 3.3 Triangles
Every triangle has three sides and three interior angles.

## Special Triangles
1. Equilateral Triangle

: A triangle with three congruent sides. All interior angles' measure is $60^\circ$.

2. Isosceles Triangles

: A triangle with at least two congruent sides. If a triangle has two congruent sides, then the angles opposite the two sides are congruent.

3. Right Triangle

:A triangle with an interior right angle. The opposite the right angle is called the __hypotenuse__: the other two sides are called __legs__.
* __Pythagorean theorem__
: $(Hypotenuse)^2=(leg_1)^2+(leg_2)^2$
* $30^\circ - 60^\circ -90^\circ$ triangle
* $45^\circ - 45^\circ -90^\circ$ triangle

## How to measure area of triangle

The area of a triangle equals one-half the length of a vase and the height corresponding to the vase.

Three triangles above have areas, $\frac{(15)(6)}{2}$, or 45.
