# Arithmetic
Arithmetic is an elementary part of mathematics that consists of basic operations on numbers - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
## 1.1 Integers
The integers are the numbers 1,2,3,..., and 0, and their negatives -1, -2, -3,...
The set of integers is {...,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2,...}


* Factor & Divisor

$$6*4=24$$

6 and 4 are factors of 24. The integers 2, 12, 3, and 8 are also factors of 24, since (2)(12)=24 and (3)(8)=24. Also, 24 is divisible by each .

__The least common multiple__ of two nonzero integers $a$ and $b$ is the least positive integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$.

(The least common multiple of 24 and 30) = 120

__The greatest common divisor__(or __greatest common factor__)of two nonzero integers $a$ and $b$ is the greatest positive integer that is a divisor of both $a$ and $b$. 

(The greatest common divisor of 24 and 30) = 6

* Quotient & Remainder

$$ 25 / 4= 6 ...1$$
When 25 is divided by 4, the result can be viewed as a __quotient(6)__ with a __remainder(1)__.

* Even & Odd

If an integer is divisible by 2, it is an __even integer__{...-4,-2,0,2,4,...}; otherwise it is an __odd integer__{...,-3,-1,1,3,...}.

* Prime number & Prime factorization

A __prime number__ is an integer greater than 1 that has only two positive divisors. For example, 13 has only two positive divisors, 1 and 13, itself. 
$$14=(2)(7)$$
$$24=(2)(2)(2)(3)=(2)^3(3)$$
Every integer greater than 1 is a prime number or can be expressed as a product of prime divisors. Such an expression is called a __prime factorization__. The number in that expression is called a __composite number__.

## 1.2 Fraction

A Fraction is a number of the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b\ne 0$.
The integer $a$ is __numerator__ of the fraction and $b$ is __denominator__. A __rational number__ is any number that can be written as a fraction, where both numberator($a$) and the denominator($b$) are integers, and $b\ne 0$.

* Addiction of Fractions

To add two fractions with the same denominator, you add the numerators and keep the same deominator:
$$-\frac{8}{11}+\frac{5}{11}=\frac{-8+5}{11}= \frac{-3}{11}=-\frac{3}{11}$$

To add two fractions with different denominators, frist find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of the two integers. Then, add the numerators:
$$\frac{1}{3}-\frac{2}{5}=\frac{5}{15}-\frac{6}{15}=\frac{5-6}{15}=-\frac{1}{15}$$

* Multiplying & Dividing two fractions

To multiply two fractions, multiply the two numerators and multiply the two dnominators:
$$\frac{10}{7}*\frac{-1}{3}=\frac{(10)(-1)}{(7)(3)}=\frac{-10}{21}$$
To divide on fraction by another, first invert the second fraction,that is __reciprocal__, then multiply the two fractions:
$$\frac{17}{8}\div \frac{3}{4}=\frac{17}{8}*\frac{4}{3}=\frac{17}{2}*\frac{1}{3}=\frac{17}{6}$$

<u>Note</u>

-Numbers of the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where either $a$ or $b$ is not an integer and $b\ne0$, are fractional expressions that can be manipulated just like fractions:
$$\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}*\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3\sqrt{2}}$$


## 1.3 Exponents and Roots
* Exponents
  
Exponents are used to denote the repeated multipliction of a number by itself:
$$3^4=(3)(3)(3)(3)=81$$
$$5^3=(5)(5)(5)=125$$
In the expression 3^4, 3 is called the __baes__, 4 is called the __exponent__, and we read the expression as "3 to the fourth power" or "3 to the power of 4".
When the exponent is 2, we call the process squaring. So, we read $2^2$ as "the square of 2".

Exponents can also be negative or zero:
$$a^0=1 (a\ne0)$$
$$a^{-1}=\frac{1}{a}(a\ne0)$$

* Root

A __square root__ of a nonnegative number $n$ is a number $r$ such that $r^2=n$ and $\sqrt{n}=r$. For oders 2 and 4, the __cube root__ $a$ and __forth root__ $a$ represent numbers such that when they are raised to the powers 3 and 4, the result is $n$.

There are some important rules, where $a>0$ and $b>0$:

| Rules | Examples |
|---|:---:|
| $(\sqrt{a})^2=a$ | $(\sqrt{\pi})^2=\pi$ |
| $\sqrt{a^2}=a$ | $\sqrt{4}=2$ |
| $\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{ab}$ | $\sqrt{4}\sqrt{6}=\sqrt{24}=2\sqrt{6}$ |
| $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}=\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{15}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}$ |


## 1.4 Decimals
The decimal number system is based on representing numbers using powers of 10:
$$7,532.418=7(10^3)+5(10^2)+3(10^1)+2(10^0)+4(10^{-1})+1(10^{-2})+8(10^{-3})$$

Some decimal will mterminate, or repeat without end, as in $\frac{1}{9}=0.111...$. However, there are some decimals that are not terminating or repeating:
$$\sqrt{2}=1.41421356...$$
Such numbers are called __irrational numbers__.

## 1.5 Real Numbers
The set of __real numbers__ consists of all rational numbers and all irrational numbers. The set of real numbers can be represented by a number line is called the __real number line__.

* Interval

$x\<y$ means that a real number $x$ is less than a real number $y$. Also, a real number $y$ is greater than $x$.

## 1.6 Ratio
If $s$ and $t$ are positive quantities, then the ratio of $s$ to $t$ can be written as the fraction $\frac{s}{t}$ and the ratio $s:t$

A __proportion__ is an equation relating two ratios; $\frac{9}{12}=\frac{3}{4}$. To solve a problem with ratios, you can solve it by cross multiplication.

_Example_ $$\frac{x}{49}=\frac{3}{21}$$
$$x=\frac{(3)(49)}{21}=7$$


## 1.7 Percent

The term __percent__ means _per hundred_, or _hundredths_. Percents are ratios that are often used to represent _parts of a whole_.

1 pecent means 1 part out of 100 parts, or $\frac{1}{100}$

$$\frac{part}{whole} \approx \frac{amount of increase or decrease}{base}$$

* Percent vs Percent point

The term __percent point__ means a differnece between percent and percent; a unit, %p, pp. 

For example,

increasing from 50% to 60%, it increases 20% or 10%p

decreasing from 2% to 1%, it decreases 50% or 1%p

So, you should check either percent or percent point when you analyze datas.
